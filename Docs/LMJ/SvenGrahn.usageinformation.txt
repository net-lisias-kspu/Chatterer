Hello sir.

My name is Chris ---.  I am a hobbyist programmer and have been developing a free, open-source audio add-on for the spaceflight simulator game Kerbal Space Program (kerbalspaceprogram.com).  With your permission and all due credit given, I would like to include modified versions of some of the russian language radio chatter from your site with my download.

Using a large number of samples (reversed and pitched up to give the feeling of alien but almost human language) from the NASA Audio Archives, my add-on simulates radio chatter between between a ship's crew and mission control.  A short demonstration made by another player can give a better idea of what is going on http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKGyF4crU_g.

Thank you for your consideration!

Chris,

Go ahead and do what you  propose!

Sven
